### Class Exercise
##### Monday 
Exercise taken from Stoyan Stefanov's 'Object Oriented Javascript' book <br/>
1. Create an object called 'shape' that has a 'type' property and a 'getType' method. <br/>
2. Define a Triangle constructor function whose prototype is shape. Objects created with Triangle should have three own properties: a, b, c representing the sides of a triangle. (these properties should be passes in as arguments). Triangle should also have a 'type' property of 'triangle'<br/>
3. Add a new method to the prototype called getPerimeter (this method should return the sum of all three sides).
